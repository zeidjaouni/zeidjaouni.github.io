    <h4>IF YOU SEE SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING<br><br>
        This Conspiracy Proves That We Should Not<br>Trust Waldo.<br>
        Seriously, do not trust this man Waldo whoever<br> he is!<br>
        
        Where is Waldo, a fun, attentive, impatient game, it has been a great success ever since its release and has a great impact all around the world,  but did you really think about ‹Wheres Waldo› and the reason why he is always hiding from us??? Think about this, Waldo is always trying to find crowded places so that he wouldnt be seen or noticed, he would even have people dress and look like him to trick the audience. </h4>
</div>
<div class="theory2">
    <h4>Why are you always hiding Waldo? Are you hiding from someone, an individual, a group, the government, a country? Are you trying to run away, maybe sneak into places? 
        Well guess what, you are stuck in this book where you will not find an exit from. So even though we find it hard to find you, we know you are there. 
        Is it really a game?

        This is a joke, 
        or maybe?</h4>
