   <h2>The London Eye Mystery</h2>
   <h5>Siobhan Dowd</h5>
   <div class="summary">
    The London Eye Mystery by Siobhan Dowd, published in 2007, is a cross between a Sherlock Holmes adventure and a Temple Grandin autobiography. Temple Grandin is known for her advocacy of the humane treatment of farm animals and her struggles to explain the unique perspectives of others like her who live on the autism spectrum. The story revolves around the Spark family. Ted (age 13) is the protagonist. He has an older sister, Kat. Their mom, Faith, is a nurse, and their father, Ben, is a demolitions expert. Ted and Kat take their cousin, Salim, who is visiting from Manchester, on a sightseeing tour of London. Salim rides on the London Eye, the Ferris wheel on the Thames in London. But Ted and Kat don't see him get off. It's almost as if he disappeared into thin air. The novel follows Ted and Kat as they try to unravel the mystery of Salim's disappearance.
